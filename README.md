## The Data Set

There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).

The dimension of a color image is 32x32 pixels and is made up of 3 channels (Red, Green, Blue = RGB) for each pixel present in them. The values for each channel range from 0 to 255, allowing each pixel in the image to be colored. Considering the above, you have 32 x 32 x 3 = 3072 data per image.
